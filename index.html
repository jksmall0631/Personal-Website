          <h2>hey there,</h2>
          <p>
            my name is Joshua Small.
          </p>
          <p>
            front-end developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            designer.
          </p>
          <p>
            analytical thinker.
          </p>
          <p>
            hard worker.
          </p>
          <p>
            I design and build clean, easy to use websites. There are a handful of things I really care about;
            quality, structure, tech, design, and life-long learning. These are the assets I apply to my work.
            I do well in a group environment, contributing my unique vision, ambition, and a diverse skillset.
            Currently making my way through The Turing School of Software and design, sharpening those skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I'm not on my computer, you'll probably find me in the snow somewhere.
