            my name is Joshua Small.

          <p class="center">

            I design and build clean, easy to use websites. There are a handful of things I really care about;
            quality, structure, tech, design, and life-long learning. These are the assets I apply to my work.
            I do well in a group environment, contributing my unique vision, ambition, and a diverse skillset.
            Currently making my way through The Turing School of Software and design, sharpening those skills.

            If I'm not on my computer, you'll probably find me in the snow somewhere.
